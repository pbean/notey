# Step 2: Plan

## RULES

- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- No intermediate approvals.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Draft resume check. If `{spec_file}` exists with `status: draft`, read it and capture the verbatim `<frozen-after-approval>...</frozen-after-approval>` block as `preserved_intent`. Otherwise `preserved_intent` is empty.
2. Investigate codebase. _Isolate deep exploration in sub-agents/tasks where available. To prevent context snowballing, instruct subagents to give you distilled summaries only._
3. Read `./spec-template.md` fully. Fill it out based on the intent and investigation. If `{preserved_intent}` is non-empty, substitute it for the `<frozen-after-approval>` block in your filled spec before writing. Write the result to `{spec_file}`.
4. Self-review against READY FOR DEVELOPMENT standard.
5. If intent gaps exist, do not fantasize, do not leave open questions, HALT and ask the human. (`{auto_mode}`: escalate `CRITICAL` `intent-gap` per automation-mode.md instead.)
6. Token count check (see SCOPE STANDARD). If spec exceeds 4000 tokens:
   - Show user the token count.
   - HALT and ask human: `[S] Split — carve off secondary goals` | `[K] Keep full spec — accept the risks` (`{auto_mode}`: choose **S** without asking.)
   - On **S**: Propose the split — name each secondary goal. Append deferred goals to `{deferred_work_file}` following `./deferred-work-format.md`. Rewrite the current spec to cover only the main goal — do not surgically carve sections out; regenerate the spec for the narrowed scope. Continue to checkpoint.
   - On **K**: Continue to checkpoint with full spec.

### CHECKPOINT 1

**If `{auto_mode}`:** do not present the menu or note below. Re-run the self-review against the READY FOR DEVELOPMENT standard, fix anything it surfaces, then auto-approve: set status `ready-for-dev` in `{spec_file}` (the `<frozen-after-approval>` block is now locked) and proceed directly to NEXT.

Present summary. Display the spec file path as a CWD-relative path (no leading `/`) so it is clickable in the terminal. If token count exceeded 4000 and user chose [K], include the token count and explain why it may be a problem.

After presenting the summary, display this note:

Before approving, you can open the spec file in an editor or ask me questions and tell me what to change. You can also use `bmad-advanced-elicitation`, `bmad-party-mode`, or `bmad-auto-review` skills, ideally in another session to avoid context bloat.

---

HALT and ask human: `[A] Approve` | `[E] Edit`

- **A**: Re-read `{spec_file}` from disk.
  - **If the file is missing:** HALT. Tell the user the spec file is gone and STOP — do not write anything to `{spec_file}`, do not set status, do not proceed to Step 3. Nothing below this point runs.
  - **If the file exists:** Compare the content to what you wrote. If it has changed since you wrote it, acknowledge the external edits — show a brief summary of what changed — and proceed with the updated version. Then set status `ready-for-dev` in `{spec_file}`. Everything inside `<frozen-after-approval>` is now locked — only the human can change it. → Step 3.
- **E**: Apply changes, then return to CHECKPOINT 1.
